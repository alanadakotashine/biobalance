Ecosystem Disruption: Oil Spill!
Ecosystem Disruption: Red Tide!
Ecosystem Disruption: Whale!
Oil spills can occur when drilling rigs or tankers malfunction.  They are detremental to the ocean's ecosystem in many ways.  The oil can change the temperature and affect the buoyancy of the water, coat phytoplankon, blind animals, and get stuck in fish's gills.  This oil spill has killed 90% of your phytoplankton, 25% of your jellyfish, 75% of your tuna, and 50% of your sharks.
Red tide, also known as algal bloom, is a naturally-occuring phenomenon in which phytoplankton populations suddenly accumulate in such high concentrations that they prevent fish from breathing.  The exact cause of red tide is unknown.  This onset of red tide has doubled your phytoplankton population; however, it's killed 98% of your jellyfish, 90% of your tuna, and 25% of your sharks.
Although whales are the world's largest mammals, many species of whales live off of surprisingly small creatures.  A blue whale can eat 7,900 pounds of the krill and phytoplankton every day!  This whale has eaten 99% of your phytoplankton.
