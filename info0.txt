Organism: Plant
Organism: Rabbit
Organism: Wolf
Plants use the sunlight to create energy in a process called photosynthesis.  In this ecosystem, plants are eaten by bunnies.
Rabbits are herbivores; they get their energy by feeding on leafy green plants.  Their predators include mammels such as foxes, badgers, and wolves.
Wolves don't have any natural predators in this ecosystem.  They get their energy primarily from smaller mammels such as rabbits (though when hunting in a pack can prey on organisms as big as moose!)
