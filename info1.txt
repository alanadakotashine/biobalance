Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that live in the ocean.  They create energy from sunlight using photosynthesis.  Phytoplankton are vital to the ocean ecosystem; they feed all kinds of organisms, including rotifers (microscopic animals), molluscs, clams, and jellyfish.
Jellyfish, the oldest multi-organ animal, are organisms that feed on phytoplankton (as well as anything else that get caught in their tentacles!).  Their name is somewhat of a misnomer, as they aren't fish at all, but are in the phylum Cnidaria.  Their major predators include Tuna, swordfish, moonfish, and sea turtles.
Tuna are fish that feed on jellyfish, as well as smaller fish, squid, and crustaceans.  Their natural predators include sharks and orcas.
Sharks are fish that feed on large fish such as tuna.  Although they can be killed by whales, they're for the most part--and in this model--considered to be at the top of the food chain.
